# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (Assignment Submission)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to be able to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. [coursera assignment description]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Must install on your workstation:
```
R Console or RStudio (at least R version 3.5.1)
R package (stringr and dplyr)
```

Must have a copy of UCI HAR Dataset on your working directory. 
``` 
You can get it here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
```

### Execution

Download run_analysis.R and place it on the same directory as with the UCI HAR Dataset

Open your local console (terminal for Mac and Ubuntu users, cmd for Windows user). 
Go to the directory of your UCI HAR Dataset and run_analysis.R

Execute file using the command
```
Rscript run_analysis.R
```

If authorization is requested, re-run using the command
```
sudo Rscript run_analysis.R
```
then give your password (worry not if no * or signs of you writing get shown, that's just how sudo works)

### That's it! 

Just view the resultant output file and there you have it :)
